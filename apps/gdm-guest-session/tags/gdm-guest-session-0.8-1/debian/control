Description: gdm extension for guest session
 This package adds support for starting a guest session through gdm's
 flexiserver, which any already logged in user can launch.
 .
 It creates a temporary guest account with a temporary home directory and
 some restricted privileges (such as not being able to read any home 
 directory or do any permanent change to the system).
 .
 Just call /usr/share/gdm/guest-session/guest-session-launch to start the
 session.
