	<title>What are visual effects?</title>
	<para>
	Ubuntu includes special visual effects which are intended to make your 
	desktop more fun and easier to use. These include translucent windows, 
	3D desktop capabilities, shadow effects, motion effects and animations.

	<para>
	Visual effects are enabled by default, but it is not necessary to have them 
	turned on.
	</para>
	<para>
	If visual effects are not enabled, your graphics card may not support them. 
	Try <link linkend="compiz-configure">turning them on manually</link> to 
	check if this is the case.

	<title>Common problems</title>
	<para>
	If you experience problems when using visual effects, it is advisable to 
	disable them by opening &desktop-effects; and selecting

		<para>
		If you receive an error message saying that 
		<quote>Visual effects could not be enabled</quote>, it is likely that 
		your graphics driver does not currently support visual effects.
		</para>
		<para>
		In this case, you will not be able to use visual effects with your 
		default graphics driver. However, you may be able to use a 
		<ulink type='help' url='ghelp:hardware#restricted-manager'>restricted 
		driver</ulink> instead.

		If your computer runs slowly, disabling visual effects may improve 
		performance. Visual effects require more system resources, and so older 
		or less powerful computers may not be able to cope with the extra load.
