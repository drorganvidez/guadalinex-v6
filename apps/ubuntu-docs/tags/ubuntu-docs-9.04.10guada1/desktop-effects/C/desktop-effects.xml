		<title>What are visual effects?</title>
			<para>Ubuntu includes special visual effects which are intended to make your desktop more fun and easier to use. These include:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Translucent windows</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>3D desktop capabilities</para>

				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Visual effects are enabled by default, but it is not necessary to have them turned on. In addition, users of computers with certain graphics cards may find that visual effects do not function properly on their computer, or cause the computer to operate more slowly than it would with the effects turned off.</para>

		<title>Configuring visual effects</title>
		<para>Press &desktop-effects; to change basic options relating to visual effects.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para>Select <guilabel>None</guilabel> to provide a simple desktop environment without any effects.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>Select <guilabel>Normal</guilabel> to provide a good balance between attractiveness and performance.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>Select <guilabel>Extra</guilabel> to provide an aesthetically pleasing set of graphics.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>When you select a new option, it may take several seconds for the change to be applied automatically. During this time, your screen may flicker briefly.  Once the settings have been applied successfully, you will see a dialog box asking your confirmation to either keep the new settings or to revert to your previous settings. If you find that the new settings work correctly, then click 'Keep Settings'. Otherwise click 'Use Previous Settings'. You will be taken back to your previous settings if you do not select anything for 40 seconds.</para>

		<title>Enabling extra effects</title>
		<para>As well as the visual effects which are available by default, many additional effects are available. These range from effects intended to make it easier to use your computer, to ones which are just for fun.</para>

		<procedure>
			<step>
				<para>Install the <application>compizconfig-settings-manager</application> package (see <ulink type='help' url='ghelp:add-applications'>Adding, Removing and Updating Applications</ulink>)</para>

		<title>Common problems</title>
		<para>If you experience problems when using visual effects, it is advisable to disable them by opening &desktop-effects; and selecting <guilabel>No effects</guilabel>.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>If you receive an error message saying that <quote>Visual effects could not be enabled</quote>, it is likely that your graphics driver does not currently support visual effects.</para>
				<para>In this case, you will not be able to use visual effects with your default graphics driver. However, you may be able to use a <ulink type='help' url='ghelp:hardware#restricted-manager'>restricted driver</ulink> instead.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If your computer runs slowly, disabling visual effects may improve performance. Visual effects require more system resources, and so older or less powerful computers may not be able to cope with the extra load.</para>
