	      To format a hard disk, device or partition means to prepare

	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The operation of formatting a hard disk or partition is when

	    </para>
	    <para>
	      When you buy a disk it is usually not formatted, and cannot yet
	      be used for storing data. When you format the device, you will
	      notice that the free space on it is less than the original size. This
	      is due to the fact that some space has to be used to make the
	      device usable; this space is occupied by the filesystem. Also, disk 
	      manufacturers often use a different standard to measure disk capacity, 
	      which results in a further discrepancy.

		<listitem>
