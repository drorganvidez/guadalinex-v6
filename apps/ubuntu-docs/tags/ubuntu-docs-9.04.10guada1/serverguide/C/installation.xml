    <para>
    There are a few differences between the <emphasis>Ubuntu Server Edition</emphasis> and the 
    <emphasis>Ubuntu Desktop Edition</emphasis>.  It should be noted that both editions use the same

	    Installing the package groups is accomplished using the <application>tasksel</application> utility.  
	    One of the important difference between Ubuntu (or Debian) and other GNU/Linux distribution is that, when 
            installed, a package is also configured to reasonable defaults, eventually prompting you for additional required 
            information. Likewise, when installing a task, the packages are not only installed, but also configured to provided
            a fully integrated service.

            Once the installation process has finished you can view a list of available tasks by entering the following from a 
            terminal prompt:

<screen>
<command>tasksel --list-tasks</command>
</screen>
	    <note>
	      <para>
	      The output will list tasks from other Ubuntu based distributions such as Kubuntu and Edubuntu.
	      Note that you can also invoke the <command>tasksel</command> command by itself, which will bring up a menu 
              of the different tasks available.
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <para>
	    You can view a list of which packages are installed with each task using the <emphasis>--task-packages</emphasis> option. 
	    For example, to list the packages installed with the <emphasis>DNS Server</emphasis> task enter the following:
	    </para>
<screen>
<command>tasksel --task-packages dns-server</command>
</screen>	
	    <para>
	    The output of the command should list:

        <para>
        RAID is a method of configuring multiple hard drives to act as one, reducing the 
        probability of catastrophic data loss in case of drive failure. RAID is implemented in either software 
        (where the operating system knows about both drives and actively maintains both of them) or hardware 
        (where a special controller makes the OS think there's only one drive and maintains the drives 'invisibly').

        The RAID software included with current versions of Linux (and Ubuntu) is based on the <application>'mdadm'</application>

          At some point in the life of the computer a disk failure event may occur.  When this happens, using Software RAID, the operating
          system will place the array into what is known as a <emphasis>degraded</emphasis> state.
          </para>

          <para>
          If the array has become degraded, due to the chance of data corruption, by default Ubuntu Server Edition will boot 
          to <emphasis>initramfs</emphasis> after thirty seconds.  Once the initramfs has booted there is a fifteen second 
          prompt giving you the option to go ahead and boot the system, or attempt manual recover.  Booting to the initramfs
          prompt may or may not be the desired behavior, especially if the machine is in a remote location.  Booting to a 
          degraded array can be configured several ways:

          Sometimes a disk can change to a <emphasis>faulty</emphasis> state even though there is nothing physically wrong with the drive. 
          It is usually worthwhile to remove the drive from the array then re-add it.  This will cause the drive to re-sync with the array.
          If the drive will not sync with the array, it is a good indication of hardware failure.
