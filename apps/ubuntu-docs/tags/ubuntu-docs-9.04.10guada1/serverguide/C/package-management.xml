	<title>Package Management</title>
        <para>Ubuntu features a comprehensive package management system for the installation, upgrade, configuration, and removal of software.  In addition to providing access to an organized base of over 17,000 software packages for your Ubuntu computer, the package management facilities also feature dependency resolution capabilities and software update checking.
        </para>
        <para>
        Several tools are available for interacting with Ubuntu's package management system, from simple command-line utilities which may be easily automated by system administrators, to a simple graphical interface which is easy to use by those new to Ubuntu.
        </para>
  <sect1 id="package-management-introduction" status="review">
	<title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
        Ubuntu's package management system is derived from the same system used by the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.  The package files contain all of the necessary files, meta-data, and instructions to implement a particular functionality or software application on your Ubuntu computer.
        </para>
        <para>
        Debian package files typically have the extension '.deb', and typically exist in <emphasis role="italics">repositories</emphasis> which are collections of packages found on various media, such as CD-ROM discs, or online.  Packages are normally of the pre-compiled binary format; thus installation is quick and requires no compiling of software.
        </para>
        <para>
        Many complex packages use the concept of <emphasis role="italics">dependencies</emphasis>.  Dependencies are additional packages required by the principal package in order to function properly.  For example, the speech synthesis package <application>Festival</application> depends upon the package <application>libasound2</application>, which is a package supplying the <application>ALSA</application> sound library needed for audio playback.  In order for <application>Festival</application> to function, it and all of it's dependencies must be installed. The software management tools in Ubuntu will do this automatically.
        </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="apt-get" status="review">
	<title>Apt-Get</title>
        <para>
        The <application>apt-get</application> command is a powerful command-line tool used to work with Ubuntu's <emphasis>Advanced Packaging Tool</emphasis> (APT) performing such functions as installation of new software packages, upgrade of existing software packages, updating of the package list index, and even upgrading the entire Ubuntu system.
        </para>
        <para>
        Being a simple command-line tool, <application>apt-get</application> has numerous advantages over other package management tools available in Ubuntu for server administrators.  Some of these advantages include ease of use over simple terminal connections (SSH) and the ability to be used in system administration scripts, which can in turn be automated by the <application>cron</application> scheduling utility.
        </para>
        <para>
        Some examples of popular uses for the <application>apt-get</application> utility:
        <itemizedlist>
               <listitem>
                <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">Install a Package</emphasis>: Installation of packages using the <application>apt-get</application> tool is quite simple.  For example, to install the network scanner <emphasis role="italics">nmap</emphasis>, type the following:
<screen>
<command>sudo apt-get install nmap</command>
</screen>
                </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">Remove a Package</emphasis>: Removal of a package or packages is also a straightforward and simple process. To remove the nmap package installed in the previous example, type the following:
<screen>
<command>sudo apt-get remove nmap</command>
</screen>
                </para>
                <tip>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Multiple Packages</emphasis>: You may specify multiple packages to be installed or removed, separated by spaces.  
                </para>
                </tip>
		<para>
	        Also, adding the <emphasis>--purge</emphasis> options to <command>apt-get remove</command> will remove the package 
                configuration files as well.  This may or may not be the desired effect so use with caution.

                <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">Update the Package Index</emphasis>: The APT package index is essentially a database of available packages from the repositories defined in the <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file.  To update the local package index with the latest changes made in repositories, type the following:
<screen>
<command>sudo apt-get update</command>
</screen>
                </para>
                </listitem>

                <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">Upgrade Packages</emphasis>: Over time, updated versions of packages currently installed on your computer may become available from the package repositories (for example security updates).  To upgrade your system, first update your package index as outlined above, and then type:
<screen>
<command>sudo apt-get upgrade</command>
</screen>
                </para>

        Actions of the <application>apt-get</application> command, such as installation and removal of packages, are logged in the /var/log/dpkg.log log file.

	<title>Aptitude</title>
        <para>
        <application>Aptitude</application> is a menu-driven, text-based front-end to the <emphasis>Advanced Packaging Tool</emphasis> (APT) system. Many of the common package management functions, such as installation, removal, and upgrade, are performed in <application>Aptitude</application> with single-key commands, which are typically lowercase letters.
        </para>
        <para>
        <application>Aptitude</application> is best suited for use in a non-graphical terminal environment to ensure proper functioning of the command keys.  You may start <application>Aptitude</application>

<screen>
<command>sudo aptitude</command>
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
        When <application>Aptitude</application> starts, you will see a menu bar at the top of the screen and two panes below the menu bar.  The top pane contains package categories, such as <emphasis role="italics">New Packages</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italics">Not Installed Packages</emphasis>.

		<title>Extra Repositories</title>
          <para>
          In addition to the officially supported package repositories available for Ubuntu, there exist additional community-maintained repositories which add thousands more potential packages for installation.  Two of the most popular are the <emphasis>Universe</emphasis> and <emphasis>Multiverse</emphasis> repositories. These repositories are not officially supported by Ubuntu, but because they are maintained by the community they generally provide packages which are safe for use with your Ubuntu computer. 
          </para>
		  <note><para>Packages in the <emphasis>Multiverse</emphasis> repository often have licensing issues that prevent them from being distributed with a free operating system, and they may be illegal in your locality.</para></note>
          <warning>
          <para>
          Be advised that neither the <emphasis>Universe</emphasis> or <emphasis>Multiverse</emphasis> repositories contain officially supported packages. In particular, there may not be security updates for these packages.
          </para>
          </warning>
          <para>
          Many other package sources are available, sometimes even offering only one package, as in the case of package sources provided by the developer of a single application.  You should always be very careful and cautious when using non-standard package sources, however.  Research the source and packages carefully before performing any installation, as some package sources and their packages could render your system unstable or non-functional in some respects.

          By default, the <emphasis>Universe</emphasis> and
