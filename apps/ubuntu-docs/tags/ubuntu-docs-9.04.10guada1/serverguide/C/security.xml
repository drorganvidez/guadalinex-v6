	<title>Security</title>
	<para>
	Security should always be considered when installing, deploying, and using any type of computer system.  Although a fresh installation of Ubuntu is relatively safe for immediate use on the Internet, it is important to have a balanced understanding of your systems security posture based on how it will be used after deployment.
	</para>
	<para>
	This chapter provides an overview of security related topics as they pertain to Ubuntu &distro-rev; Server Edition, and outlines simple measures you may use to protect your server and network from any number of potential security threats.

	<title>User Management</title>
	<para>
	User management is a critical part of maintaining a secure system.  Ineffective user and privilege management often lead many systems into being compromised.  Therefore, it is important that you understand how you can protect your server through simple and effective user account management techniques.
	</para>
  <sect2 id="where-is-root" status="review">
	<title>Where is root?</title>
	<para>
	Ubuntu developers made a conscientious decision to disable the administrative root account by default in all Ubuntu installations.  This does not mean that the root account has been deleted or that it may not be accessed.  It merely has been given a password which matches no possible encrypted value, therefore may not log in directly by itself.
	</para>
	<para>
	Instead, users are encouraged to make use of a tool by the name of <application>sudo</application> to carry out system administrative duties.  <application>Sudo</application> allows an authorized user to  temporarily elevate their privileges using their own password instead of having to know the password belonging to the root account.  This simple yet effective methodology provides accountability for all user actions, and gives the administrator granular control over which actions a user can perform with said privileges.

	When a new user is created, the adduser utility creates a brand new home directory named <filename class="directory">/home/username</filename>, respectively.

	If your server will be home to multiple users, you should pay close attention to the user home directory permissions to ensure confidentiality.  By default, user home directories in Ubuntu are created with world read/execute permissions.   This means that all users can browse and access the contents of other users home directories.  This may not be suitable for your environment.

	<title>Password Policy</title>
	<para>
	A strong password policy is one of the most important aspects of your security posture.  Many successful security breaches involve simple brute force and dictionary attacks against weak passwords.  If you intend to offer any form of remote access involving your local password system, make sure you adequately address minimum password complexity requirements, maximum password lifetimes, and frequent audits of your authentication systems.
	</para>
  <sect3 id="minimum-password-length" status="review">
	<title>Minimum Password Length</title>

	By default, Ubuntu requires a minimum password length of 4 characters, as well as some basic entropy checks.  These values are controlled in the file <filename>/etc/pam.d/common-password</filename>, which is outlined below.
	</para>
<programlisting>
password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure min=4 max=8 md5

	<note>
	<para>
	The <varname>max=8</varname> variable does not represent the maximum length of a password.  It only means that complexity requirements will not be checked on passwords over 8 characters.

	Simply disabling/locking a user account will not prevent a user from logging into your server remotely if they have previously set up RSA public key authentication. They will still be able to gain shell access to the server, without the need for any password.  Remember to check the users home directory for files that will allow for this type of authenticated SSH access.  e.g. <filename>/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>.

	<para>
	Remove or rename the directory <filename class="directory">.ssh/</filename> in the user's home folder to prevent further SSH authentication capabilities.

	Be sure to check for any established SSH connections by the disabled user, as it is possible they may have existing inbound or outbound connections.  Kill any that are found.

	Ubuntu installs GNU GRUB as its default boot loader, which allows for great flexibility and recovery options.

Also, by default, alternate boot options are available for each kernel entry that may be used for system recovery, aptly labeled (recovery mode).  Recovery mode simply boots the corresponding kernel image into single user mode (init 1), which lands the administrator at a root prompt without the need for any password.

			  To do this, the kernel must modify the <emphasis>source</emphasis>
			  IP address of each packet so that replies will be routed back to it, rather than
			  to the private IP address that made the request, which is impossible over the 
			  Internet.  Linux uses <emphasis>Connection Tracking</emphasis>
			  (conntrack) to keep track of which connections belong to which machines and reroute
			  each return packet accordingly.  Traffic leaving your private network is thus
			  &quot;masqueraded&quot; as having originated from your Ubuntu gateway machine.
			  This process is referred to in Microsoft documentation as Internet
			  Connection Sharing.

	      </para>
	      <para>

            One of the most common forms of cryptography today is <emphasis>public-key</emphasis> cryptography.
            Public-key cryptography utilizes a <emphasis>public key</emphasis> and a <emphasis>private key</emphasis>.
            The system works by <emphasis>encrypting</emphasis> information using the public key.  The information can  
            then only be <emphasis>decrypted</emphasis> using the private key.
            </para>
            <para>
            A common use for public-key cryptography is encrypting application traffic using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or 
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.  For example, configuring Apache to provide <emphasis>HTTPS</emphasis>, the
            HTTP protocol over SSL.  This allows a way to encrypt traffic using a protocol that does not itself provide encryption.
            </para>
            <para>
            A <emphasis>Certificate</emphasis> is a method used to distribute a <emphasis>public key</emphasis> and other information
            about a server and the organization who is responsible for it.  Certificates can be digitally signed by a 
            <emphasis>Certificate Authority</emphasis> or CA.  A CA is a trusted third party that has confirmed that the information
            contained in the certificate is accurate.

              To set up a secure server using public-key cryptography, in most cases, you
              send your certificate request (including your public key),
              proof of your company's identity, and payment to a CA. The
              CA verifies the certificate request and your identity, and
              then sends back a certificate for your secure server.  
             Alternatively, you can create your own <emphasis>self-signed</emphasis>
             certificate.

            <para>
             Most Web browsers, and computers, that support SSL have a list of CAs whose
             certificates they automatically accept. If a browser
             encounters a certificate whose authorizing CA is not in the
             list, the browser asks the user to either accept or decline
             the connection.  Also, other applications may generate an error message when using
             a self-singed certificate.

        You can now enter your passphrase. For best security, it should

        You can also run your secure service without a passphrase.
        This is convenient because you will not need to enter the
        passphrase every time you start your secure service. But it
        is highly insecure and a compromise of the key means a
        compromise of the server as well.

        In any case, you can choose to run your secure service without

        Once you run the above command, the insecure key will be stored

        file to generate the CSR without passphrase.
        </para>

 	You can now submit this CSR file
