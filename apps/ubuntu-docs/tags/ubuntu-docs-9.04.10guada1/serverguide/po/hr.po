"The purpose of IP Masquerading is to allow machines with private, non-"
"routable IP addresses on your network to access the Internet through the "
"machine doing the masquerading. Traffic from your private network destined "
"for the Internet must be manipulated for replies to be routable back to the "
"machine that made the request. To do this, the kernel must modify the "
"<emphasis>source</emphasis> IP address of each packet so that replies will "
"be routed back to it, rather than to the private IP address that made the "
"request, which is impossible over the Internet. Linux uses "
"<emphasis>Connection Tracking</emphasis> (conntrack) to keep track of which "
"connections belong to which machines and reroute each return packet "
"accordingly. Traffic leaving your private network is thus \"masqueraded\" as "
"having originated from your Ubuntu gateway machine. This process is referred "
