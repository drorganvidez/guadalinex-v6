	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>Welcome to the <emphasis>Ubuntu Switching from Windows guide</emphasis>! The aim of this guide is to help you to replace your copy of Microsoft Windows with the Ubuntu operating system. This guide will cover each part of the process of changing your operating system, from preparing your files and settings to installing and then finally using your newly installed copy of Ubuntu.</para>
	<para>The guide is written with the non-technical person in mind, and most technical terms will be explained if used. However, it is recommended that you should have a basic knowledge of how to use a computer before attempting to follow the instructions in this guide. The instructions in the guide are targeted at users of <application>Microsoft Windows XP</application>, but may be adapted for use with other versions of Windows.</para>
	<para>We hope that you find this guide a useful tool (amongst many others) for making the switch from Windows. While it is a big step to take, it can also be an immensely rewarding one. We wish you the best of luck for the future and hope that you will enjoy using our favorite operating system as much as we do.</para>
	<para>Many Thanks,</para>
