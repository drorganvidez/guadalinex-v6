= Add your document to doc.ubuntu.com =

Using the file sidebar.inc.php found in this directory you can add or remove links to preview docs on the Documentation Team preview server, at doc.ubuntu.com

Please only add documents which have had sufficient work to make them suitable for preview.

Make sure your document is in the "make kall" or "make all" targets. Then, ensure that target builds correctly. Then, simply check the correct url of your document at http://doc.ubuntu.com/gnome or http://doc.ubuntu.com/kde. Then add your links to the file sidebar.inc.php, in the list under the relevant heading "Ubuntu" or "Kubuntu", and commit your changes to svn.

The preview server will update the links and the documents themselves once a day.

Any difficulty, contact the mailing list!
